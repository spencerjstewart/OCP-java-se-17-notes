### Needs to be studied

- Remember that assignment operators assign the variable, then return the value
- The following does not compile:

```java
static long addCandy(double fruit, float vegetables) {
   return (int)fruit+vegetables;
}
```

- The post-operators `++` and `--` assign the value, then increment/decrement
- Remember increasing order of precendence is last to first
-
